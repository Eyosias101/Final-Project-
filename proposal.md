# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Mental Health Resource

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that teaches people about mental health issues. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

We want a website that teaches people about the effect of mental health. We will use languages like HTML and CSS to create a professional looking website. At the end of the website we would like to add a journal where people could write about how they are feeling. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

We both do not plan on combining. 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I am collaborating with another a classmate called Eskinder Desta. 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

First and foremost we would like to grow my knowledge of web design. Second we would like to create website that could be improved on and maybe launched one day. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Our better outcome for this project would be adding a notepad to the bottom of the project. This function would allow the user to reflect. We think this is possible before the project's deadline, but it might be hard to integrate. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for our project would be adding JavaScript to the project and hopefully adding some creative functions to the website. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Our next step for the project is to research what mental health is and its effects. We have to be able to communicate the information. Next, we must come up with a blueprint for the website and research how to design it.
